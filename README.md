# Multipurpose Personal Assistant Program (BATI)

This is my private project that I have been developing for the past 1,5 years.
It was never intended to be published on GitHub, so I quickly uploaded the scripts and added some screenshots for people to get a grasp of what is this program about.

In the screenshots folder you can see the interface of a Calendar tab with different events marked with different colors, a System monitor tab with info about hardware in my PC, and a Media player app (WIP).
In the scripts folder there is all of the Python code I wrote + a powershell script for creating/managing new version of the program.
All the private info in stored in text files, but for privacy reasons I didn't put them here.
